calibrate instruments first, kick, snare etc
then use filtering to then plot each event on a grid to then match tempo
Requires - A tempo grid, will only work up to 16ths to start with

Some way to mimic coach mode on Roland vdrums

Use of sound gate?
filter -> FFT -> plot time-domain
pitch recognition
peak detection

Maybe use preformed drum beats which the input is measured against



Things to look up
FFT on drums
Filtered FFT
Limitations of FFT
Tempo coaching systems
audio to midi -> time domain placement
Qt framework

Libraries
FFTW from MIT

Things to be aware of
Noise in the sample

Look up freqMap array, crossoverbin ,crossovermidi, fftsize

fftsize = 2048
samplerate = 48000.0
binwidth = 23.4375
crossoverbin = 33
crossovermidi = 79
i = 1024
midi = 138.232644862303

Hamming
makewindow
processframe etc
findonsets - onsetslenght
hoptime
considerasbeat
beattrack
e.keydown

Classes used
BeatRoot

Peaks

Beatroot doesn't work for slow bpms <= 60
Doesn't start on the first beat
Adjustment for initial onset needed

 a simple time-domain onset detection algorithm was used, which finds
local peaks in the slope of a smoothed amplitude envelope using the “surfboard” method
of Schloss (1985).

Change the onset detection

Use microphone event to plot midi??
